The [Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA)](https://www.jhuapl.edu/spsa/)
optimizer is a stochastic method for optimizing real functions of a number of real variables.

This function performs SPSA optimization of the real-valued function `f` of complex variables by treating each complex varible
as a pair of real variables, starting from the complex vector `z₀` and iterating `Niter` times. Then, returns a complex matrix, `zacc`, with size `(length(z₀), Niters)`,
such that `zacc[i, j]` corresponds to the value of the `i`-th complex variable on the `j`-th iteration.

The input parameters `a`, `b`, `A`, `s`, and `t` can be provided as keyword arguments of the function.
If they are not provided explicitly, they are selected at runtime from the [`ComplexSPSA.gains`](@ref) dictionary.

Automatic calibration for the input parameter `a` can be accomplished taking `Ncalibrate` samples using the method defined on [Kandala _et. al._ (2017), Sec. 11](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05018v2.pdf#section*.11).
By default, the calibration is disabled (`Ncalibrate = 0`).
